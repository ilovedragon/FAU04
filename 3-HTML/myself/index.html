        <!-- Nature Trekking -->
        <p>In my spare time, I enjoy heading outdoors for a trek. It's a great way to soak up nature and get some exercise in. When I get back, I always feel rejuvenated and ready to take on whatever comes my way.</p>
        <p>Here are a few of the nature parks where I frequently go trekking.</p>

        <h3 id="gym">Gym work outs</h3>
        <p>
            In addition to trekking, I also like going to the gym to work out. It's another way I stay active and healthy, whether it's lifting weights, doing cardio, or trying out new workouts, the gym provides me with a diverse range of activities to keep my body strong and energized.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below are some of the gym equipment that I find most beneficial during my workout sessions. 
            The treadmill is a favorite, as it offers a cardio workout that I enjoy while walking or running. 
            Additionally, I appreciate the low-impact workout provided by the elliptical machine, which simulates various movements like walking, running, or stair climbing. 
            The stationary bike is another staple, offering a convenient way to improve cardiovascular health and leg strength. 
            Alongside dumbbells, these pieces of equipment contribute to my fitness and well-being, keeping me motivated and healthy.

                An elliptical machine or cross-trainer<sup> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_trainer">Elliptical trainer wiki</a></sup> is a stationary exercise machine used to stair climb, walk, or run without causing excessive pressure to the joints, hence decreasing the risk of impact injuries.
                For this reason, people with some injuries can use an elliptical to stay fit, as the low impact affects them little.
